#
# NOTE: Distributors of geoclue may only uncomment this URL if the
#       service is used in a non-commercial manner, to quote Positon:
#
#         We generally consider a service or software commercial, when it is only
#         intended to be available (beyond free trials or other restrictions) via
#         a one-time payment, subscription, account registration or similar.
#         Funding the development through donations or optional support contracts
#         does not make the software itself commercial.
#
#         Fedora Linux, CentOS Stream, Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux all would not be
#         considered commercial by us, neither would e.g. Debian, Ubuntu or
#         elementary OS. However, RedHat Enterprise Linux and various SUSE Linux
#         Enterprise versions would be considered commercial.
#
#       For more information, contact Positon or consult their website:

# To use the Google geolocation service, uncomment this URL
# while changing YOUR_KEY to your Google API key.
#
# WARNING: Please make sure that you are complying with the Google's ToS and

# Submit data to WiFi geolocation service
# If set to true, geoclue will automatically submit network data
# each time it gets a GPS lock.
#
# Currently, only Modem GPS or Network NMEA sources are supported as providers
# of a location to submit (one at a time).
# If Modem GPS source is enabled above it will be the exclusive provider
# (regardless whether the system is actually equipped with such modem),
# otherwise Network NMEA source will be considered.
submit-data=false

# URL to submit data to a WiFi geolocation service with an Ichnaea compatible API
# (https://ichnaea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/geosubmit2.html).
# If unset, defaults to an URL defined at build-time,
# this URL is 'https://api.beacondb.net/v2/geosubmit'.
#submission-url=https://example.com/v2/geosubmit?key=YOUR_KEY

# A nickname to submit network data with. If empty, omitted from the submission.
# Otherwise, must be 2 to 32 characters long. Defaults to "geoclue".

# Compass configuration options
[compass]

# Enable Compass
enable=true

# Static source configuration options
#
# This source reads location from "geolocation" file in /etc - please
# consult geoclue(5) man page for the format description of this file.
[static-source]

# Enable the static source
# If you make use of this source, you probably should disable other location
# sources in this file so they won't override the configured static location.
enable=true

# Application configuration options
#
# NOTE: Having an entry here for an application with allowed=true means that
#       geoclue will not ask agent to authorize the application. This is to
#       ensure that applications with built-in authorization mechanism (e.g web
#       browsers) do not have to be bound to agents.
#
#       If your application is denied access to location information and your
#       operating system doesn't provide any mechanism to change that, it is
#       likely a bug in your operation system (or geoclue). The solution is to
#       report the issue with all details, rather than adding your application
#       to this list.
#
# Format:
#
# # Desktop ID of application without .desktop part
# [random-app]
#
# # Allowed access to location information?
# allowed=true|false
#
# # Is application a system component?
# system=true|false
#
# # List of UIDs of all users for which this application is allowed location
# # info access, separate by ';'. Keep it empty for allowing it for all users.
